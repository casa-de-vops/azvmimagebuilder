# Orchestrated VM Deployment Architecture - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The VM deployment system has been successfully **composited** into a clean orchestrated architecture where:

- **Workflow files** are clean trigger orchestrators
- **All complexity** is encapsulated in composite actions
- **Master orchestration actions** coordinate the entire deployment process
- **Base composite actions** handle individual deployment components

## Architecture Layers

### 1. **Workflow Layer** (Clean Triggers)
- `deploy-rhel-vm.yml` - Clean RHEL VM deployment orchestrator
- `deploy-vm-clean.yml` - Clean general VM deployment orchestrator
- Minimal code, focused on input collection and orchestration calls

### 2. **Orchestration Layer** (Master Composite Actions)
- `orchestrate-vm-deployment` - Complete deployment coordinator
- `orchestrate-vm-cleanup` - Failure cleanup coordinator
- Handle end-to-end process flow and error recovery

### 3. **Base Actions Layer** (Individual Components)
- `validate-azure-resources` - Resource validation
- `validate-arm-template` - Template validation and what-if
- `deploy-azure-vm` - VM deployment execution
- `generate-deployment-report` - Deployment reporting
- `cleanup-failed-vm-deployment` - Cleanup operations

## Key Benefits of Orchestrated Architecture

### ✅ **Simplicity**
- Workflow files are now 150+ lines instead of 300+ lines
- Single composite action call handles entire deployment
- Clear separation of concerns

### ✅ **Reusability**
- Orchestration actions can be used across multiple workflows
- Base actions can be composed differently for different scenarios
- Templates support both Linux and Windows VMs

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Changes to deployment logic happen in one place
- Easier testing and validation
- Cleaner error handling and reporting

### ✅ **Consistency**
- Standardized approach across all VM deployments
- Consistent authentication (OIDC)
- Unified logging and reporting

## Workflow Structure Example

```yaml
# Clean workflow file (deploy-rhel-vm.yml)
jobs:
  deploy-rhel-vm:
    steps:
    - name: Orchestrate RHEL VM Deployment
      uses: ./.github/actions/orchestrate-vm-deployment
      with:
        vm-name: ${{ needs.validate-and-prepare.outputs.vm-name }}
        vm-type: 'linux'
        template-path: './templates/10_Virtual_Machine_Deployment_Template/azuredeploy.linux.json'
        # All other parameters...
```

## Authentication Architecture

### OIDC Implementation
- **Client ID**: `${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}`
- **Tenant ID**: `${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}`
- **Subscription ID**: `${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }`
- **No service principal JSON** required

### Required Repository Secrets
```
AZURE_CLIENT_ID          - Azure AD application client ID
AZURE_TENANT_ID          - Azure AD tenant ID  
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID    - Azure subscription ID
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP     - Target resource group
VM_ADMIN_USERNAME        - VM administrator username
VM_ADMIN_PASSWORD        - VM administrator password
KEYVAULT_ID             - Key Vault resource ID (Linux VMs)
CERTIFICATE_URL         - Certificate URL (Linux VMs)
SUBNET_ID               - Target subnet resource ID
```

## File Organization

### Core Workflows (Clean Orchestrators)
```
.github/workflows/
├── deploy-rhel-vm.yml           # Primary RHEL deployment
├── deploy-vm-clean.yml          # General VM deployment
└── deploy-vm-modular.yml        # Legacy (deprecated)
```

### Orchestration Actions (Master Coordinators)
```
.github/actions/
├── orchestrate-vm-deployment/   # Complete deployment orchestrator
└── orchestrate-vm-cleanup/      # Cleanup orchestrator
```

### Base Composite Actions (Individual Components)
```
.github/actions/
├── validate-azure-resources/    # Resource validation
├── validate-arm-template/       # Template validation
├── deploy-azure-vm/            # VM deployment
├── generate-deployment-report/  # Reporting
└── cleanup-failed-vm-deployment/ # Cleanup operations
```

### ARM Templates
```
templates/10_Virtual_Machine_Deployment_Template/
├── azuredeploy.linux.json       # Linux VM template
├── azuredeploy.windows.json     # Windows VM template
├── azuredeploy.linux.parameters.json
├── azuredeploy.windows.parameters.json
├── README-linux.md
└── README-windows.md
```

## Deployment Process Flow

### 1. **Preparation Phase**
- Validate deployment conditions
- Generate VM and deployment names
- Check trigger conditions (manual, scheduled, workflow_run)

### 2. **Orchestrated Deployment Phase**
```bash
orchestrate-vm-deployment:
├── validate-azure-resources     # Check subscription, RG, networking
├── validate-arm-template        # Template validation + what-if
├── deploy-azure-vm              # Execute deployment
└── generate-deployment-report   # Create deployment summary
```

### 3. **Failure Recovery Phase**
```bash
orchestrate-vm-cleanup (on failure):
├── cleanup-failed-vm-deployment # Remove failed resources
├── generate-deployment-report   # Failure analysis
└── Update GitHub step summary   # Log cleanup results
```

## Testing and Validation

### Validation Scripts
- `scripts/Test-OrchestratedActions-Complete.ps1` - Complete architecture test
- `scripts/Test-RepositorySecrets.ps1` - Secret validation
- Built-in post-deployment connectivity testing

### What Gets Tested
- ✅ All orchestration actions exist and are properly structured
- ✅ Base composite actions are available and functional
- ✅ Workflows use orchestration correctly
- ✅ Authentication configuration (OIDC)
- ✅ Required secrets are referenced
- ✅ VM connectivity and functionality post-deployment

## RHEL-Specific Features

### Enterprise Capabilities
- **RHEL Version Tracking** - Version 9 support with environment variables
- **Subscription Management** - Guidance for Red Hat subscriptions
- **SELinux Integration** - Status reporting and configuration
- **Enterprise Security** - Certificate-based authentication

### Specialized Triggers
- **Manual Deployment** - `workflow_dispatch` with custom parameters
- **Automated Build Integration** - Triggers on successful RHEL image builds
- **Scheduled Testing** - Weekly validation deployments
- **Environment Support** - dev/staging/prod environment handling

## Migration from Legacy Workflows

### Before (Legacy)
- Complex 300+ line workflow files
- Inline deployment logic
- Service principal JSON authentication
- Manual error handling

### After (Orchestrated)
- Clean 150+ line trigger files
- Encapsulated composite actions
- OIDC authentication
- Automated error recovery

## Next Steps

### 1. **Deprecation Planning**
- Mark legacy workflows as deprecated
- Update documentation to reference orchestrated approach
- Plan removal of legacy files

### 2. **Extension Opportunities**
- Create Windows-specific orchestrated workflow
- Add GPU VM deployment orchestration
- Implement multi-region deployment coordination

### 3. **Enhanced Features**
- Blue/green deployment orchestration
- Automated scaling group integration
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting

## Summary

The VM deployment architecture has been **successfully composited** into a clean, maintainable, and reusable system. The `deploy-rhel-vm.yml` file is now a clean trigger orchestrator that delegates all complexity to well-structured composite actions, exactly as requested.

**Key Achievement**: All deployment complexity is now handled by composite actions, making workflows clean and focused solely on orchestration.
