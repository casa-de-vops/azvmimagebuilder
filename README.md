# Azure VM Image Builder

This repository provides comprehensive workflows, templates, and examples for building and distributing custom VM images using Azure VM Image Builder (AIB). It includes modular GitHub Actions workflows, template examples, and best practices for image building automation.

## Repository Structure

### GitHub Workflows (`.github/`)
- **`template.yaml`**: Main reusable workflow for building and distributing custom VM images
- **`GoldenLinuxImage.yml`**: Example workflow for building Linux golden images
- **`GoldenWindowsImage.yml`**: Example workflow for building Windows golden images
- **`actions/`**: Modular composite actions for image building components

### Templates (`templates/`)
Comprehensive collection of Azure Image Builder templates organized by use case:
- **Linux templates**: Custom Linux image creation examples
- **Windows templates**: Custom Windows image creation examples  
- **Shared Image Gallery**: Templates for publishing to Azure Compute Gallery
- **VNET integration**: Examples with custom networking configurations
- **Specialized scenarios**: Red Hat licensing, VHD exports, and more

### Solutions (`solutions/`)
End-to-end solutions and integration examples:
- Azure DevOps integration
- Security role configurations
- Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) optimizations
- Environment variable usage patterns

### Infrastructure as Code (`terraform/`)
Terraform configurations for setting up Azure Image Builder infrastructure and dependencies.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- GitHub repository with OIDC authentication configured
- User-assigned managed identity for Azure Image Builder

üìã **Important**: Before using the workflows, you must configure required repository secrets. See the [Repository Secrets Setup Guide](./docs/Repository-Secrets-Setup.md) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Use the Template Workflow
Add this to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/build-image.yml`):

```yaml
name: Build Custom VM Image

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      skipBuild:
        description: "Skip building new image and validate latest"
        type: boolean
        required: false
        default: false

permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build-image:
    name: Build and distribute custom VM image
    uses: ./.github/workflows/template.yaml
    with:
      templateFolder: "1_Creating_a_Custom_Linux_Shared_Image_Gallery_Image"
      templateName: "GoldenLinuxImage.json"
      templateType: "imageTemplate"
      sigResourceGroup: "rg-imagebuilder"
      sigName: "myImageGallery"
      imageDefName: "myLinuxImage"
      uaiIdentityName: "imagebuilder-identity"
      location: "westus2"
      additionalregion: "eastus2"
      runOutputName: "myCustomImage"
      vm-os-type: "Linux"
    secrets:
      AZURE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
      AZURE_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
      AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
      SUBNET_ID: ${{ secrets.SUBNET_ID }}
```
